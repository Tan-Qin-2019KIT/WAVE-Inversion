# Step length log file  
# Misfit type = L2
# Iteration 0 shows misfit of initial model (only first and last column is meaningful here)
# Iteration | optimum step length | #Forward calculations | step length guess 1 | step length guess 2 | step length guess 3 | misfit of slg1 | misfit of slg2 | misfit of slg3 | final misfit of all shots
